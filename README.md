## Pace to Plan 
Pace to Plan is an activity planning app to help people with a limited amount of energy.

The vicious cycle of overactivity and prolonged rest is a common issue for people whose energy level is low, such as chronic population and rehabilitation patients. They can easily get overexerted when performing daily activities and then rest for a long time. Both cases would harm their health, so it's important for them to understand their activity baseline so they can stop before symptom occurs.

The concept of activity pacing addresses this issue by letting people better planning their daily activities. With a clear understanding of their energy baseline, people can schedule a rest period between activities or reduce activities' intensity to avoid overexertion. However, most people lack an understanding of their energy level when practicing activity pacing alone. This app introduces a better planning method, which is to plan daily activities recurrently. Each time they plan for the next day's activity, they could reflect on their todays' performances. So through their usage, they can better understand their energy consumption over different activities and better plan their day. 
 
This system has three major components: **planning, tracking, and reflection**.

### Planning 
In the planning section, the user will first input the energy level they are comfortable with. Then add activities with user-specified energy consumption. The visual design will help users avoid putting too much high-energy-consumption activity within a short period and warn users if their energy is below the baseline.

### Tracking
On the tracking section, the app will track their plan and prompt user when an activity is happening. The user can confirm, deny, and undo an activity on the notification level to indicate whether they stick to the plan. The visual design offers users an in situ reflection about their energy status.

### Reflection
At the end of the day, the users will be asked to revisit their schedule. Their performance will be presented to them so they can plan for the next day accordingly. 

## Features Completed
- User can create a new account.
- User can log in with an existing account.
- Users can add / delete activities on the timeline
- Users can specify the duration and perceived energy consumption of planned activities.
- Users can deny the planned activity. (If they don't want to perform the planned activity, the deny option enables them to cancel the tracking on that activity)
- Users can undo activities. (If they perform different activities from planned one, the undo option enable them to cancel that incorrect record at the end of the tracking)
- Users can stop activities.(If they stop the activity during the tracking, the duration of the tracked activity will be cut off to match their real experience)
- The app will prompt users notifications to check if they are executing their plan, users will be able to perform actions on the notification level, such as deny or confirm.
- During the end-of-day reflection session, users can view their record of today’s schedule
### Partly Completed
- Users’ tiredness / energy level will be represented as different colors on activities box.
- Users can see how their energy / tiredness level change throughout the day.
